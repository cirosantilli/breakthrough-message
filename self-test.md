# How to test if this is a good method?

So how we determine if this method I'm proposing has any chance of being understood by the aliens?

Obviously this is going to be very hard as well, but here goes.

## Choosing the test subjects

First we find scientists and university who work with radio telescopes / computer science / mathematicians and give them the encoded message.

We must explicitly select people who have not seen this repository before, and make it clear to them that they must not look it up.

## General rules

We then let them write down what they understand of each payload.

We should give them a very large amount of time, and make them work in big teams since this is how the aliens would work.

We then ask them to write down every step of their reasoning, and when they reached it.

Subjects should be payed enough to devote X weekly hours to this puzzle.

There should be no reward for getting it right, or else they would cheat and look up the repository.

### Language change

We will translate all text packets to a language that subjects don't speak at all, and which has no relation to English, e.g. Chinese pinyin for example, to imitate the effect of now knowing the language.

Unfortunately, I don't see a way to remote the bias of the image packets, because there are stereotypical symbols which all educated adults understand, like the classic electron atom picture, and those may mean nothing to aliens.

## Phases

There are two things that need to be tested.

### Understanding the file format

See if they can understand the packet format, and the odd / even text / image idea.

### Deciding if the content is good

Once they understand the format, can they translate the foreign language to English?

We could also give the decoded output directly to people (without comments) and tell them to figure it out.

## Evaluation

We can just count how many phrases people translated correctly to English, in how much time.
