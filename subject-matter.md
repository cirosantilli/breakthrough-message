# Subject matter

Now comes the **hard** part.

## Goals

The message has the following goal: explain to aliens

- that we are intelligent
- where we are

so that they can come here and give use new technology.

They are almost surely way more advanced than us since we've just entered the space age, so maybe they can come to us even if we can't go to them.

Sending them our technology is useless for them from a practical point of view, but they would be interested from a cultural-artistic point of view.

## Global structure

-   simple geometric images like squares, triangles and circles.

    So if they decode those correctly, they will immediately know they are on the right path on the decoding of images.

-   numbers and basic mathematics. We can use only binary with them.

    Fractions and powers will be needed to express physical measures.

-   SI measures, in special the meter.

    We should use the hydrogen atom as much as possible, e.g.:

    - kilogram is one Avogadro hydrogen atoms
    - meter is N times the strongest hydrogen atom spectral line

    and so on.

    If they understand this, it will be a huge milestone.

    We will then add a scale to every image we send of physical objects, and it will be much easier for them to guess what we are talking about: atoms, baseballs or galaxies!

    The scale will be like the dime on close up photos.

-   astronomical objects that show where we are, from bigger to smaller:

    -   galaxies.They will see such far away objects like Andromeda exactly like us.

    -   where we are on the milky way when seen from the top. We have no photo of that, so a schema is needed.

        Supernovae remnants can serve as reference points.

    -   our view of some objects of the milky way

    -   The solar system, and earth.

This concludes the goal of explaining where we are.
